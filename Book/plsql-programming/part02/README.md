# **PL/SQL Program Structure**

This part of the book presents the basic PL/SQL programming elements and statement constructs. Chapter 4 through Chapter 6 describe conditional (IF and CASE) and sequential control statements (e.g., GOTO and NULL), loops and the CONTINUE statement introduced for loops in Oracle Database 11g, and exception handling in the PL/SQL language. When you complete this section of the book, you will know how to construct blocks of code that correlate to the complex requirements in your applications.
