# **PL/SQL Application Construction**

This part of the book is where it all comes together. By now, you’ve learned the basics. You know about declaring and working with variables. You’re an expert on error handling and loop construction. Now it’s time to build an application—and you do that by constructing the building blocks, made up of procedures, functions, packages, and triggers, as described in Chapter 17 through Chapter 19. Chapter 20 discusses managing your PL/SQL code base, including testing and debugging programs and managing dependencies; it also provides an overview of the edition-based redefinition capability introduced in Oracle Database 11g Release 2. Chapter 21 focuses on how you can use a variety of tools and techniques to get the best performance out of your PL/SQL programs. Chapter 22 describes I/O techniques for PL/SQL, from DBMS_OUTPUT (sending output to the screen) and UTL_FILE (reading and writing files) to UTL_MAIL (sending mail) and UTL_HTTP (retrieving data from a web page).
