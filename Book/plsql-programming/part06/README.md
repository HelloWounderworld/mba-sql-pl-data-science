# **Advanced PL/SQL Topics**

A language as mature and rich as PL/SQL is packed full of features that you may not use on a day-to-day basis, but that may make the crucial difference between success and failure. This part of the book focuses on those features. Chapter 23 explores the security related challenges we face as we build PL/SQL programs. Chapter 24 contains an exploration of the PL/SQL architecture, including PL/SQL’s use of memory. Chapter 25 provides guidance for PL/SQL developers who need to address issues of globalization and localization. Chapter 26 offers an introduction to the object-oriented features of Oracle. Two additional chapters, describing invoking Java and C code from PL/SQL applications, are available in full on the book’s website under the “Download Example Code” tab.
