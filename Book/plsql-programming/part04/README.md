# **SQL in PL/SQL**

This part of the book addresses a central element of PL/SQL code construction: the connection to the underlying Oracle database, which takes places through SQL (Structured Query Language). Chapter 14 through Chapter 16 show you how to define transactions that update, insert, merge, and delete tables in the database; query information from the database for processing in a PL/SQL program; and execute SQL statements dynamically, using native dynamic SQL (NDS).
